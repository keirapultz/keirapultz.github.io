### CPSC 120

My favorite labs this semester...
* Lab 9
    Lab 9, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because of how the functions worked and how challenging the lab was. It was very satisfying finally getting this lab to work, and the challenge was really fun to work through. It was a problem solving process and I enjoyed it very much.

* Lab 6 
    Lab 6, part 2 was a fun lab because it was also challenging, but the end product was really interesting because it was a game we could interact with. I thought this was one of the most engaging labs because of this. It was really fun getting to work on this lab with my partner.

* Lab 8
    Lab 8, part 2 was a fun lab for me because it was simple but satisfying. This lab reminded me of one of the projects I did in my high school computer science class, where I made rows and columns of blocks to recreate Atari Breakout. Seeing all the lines printed nicely in a triangle was also very satisfying haha.
